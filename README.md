# SimPrintsTest

3 solutions to short problems set by SimPrints.

## Notes
- Java was used as I am most experienced in C-family languages and the Java Virtual Machine means I don't have to worry about hardware limitations on short problems
- In terms of constraints, a built .jar can be found in the build folder for each project, and similarly any Java IDE with Gradle build tools should be able to rebuild the code themselves
- My general coding style is generally pragmatic, focusing on short prototyping phases, splitting problems into individual methods before combining them and cleaning at the end.
