A detail-oriented and intellectually curious programmer with an aptitude for problem solving. I am self-motivated and appreciate the need to be thorough in all aspects of my work. I recognise the need for organised planning, prototyping and following agile methodologies to produce a quality end product.
Skills
* General programming skills transferrable between all languages, including compilers/interpreters, procedural, functional and object-oriented programming, libraries and threaded programming.
